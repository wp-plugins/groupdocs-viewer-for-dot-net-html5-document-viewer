== Description ==

This plugin is developed based on the GroupDocs <a href="http://groupdocs.com/dot-net/document-viewer-library" target="_blank">HTML5 document viewer for .NET library</a>, which enables you to display over 45 different types of documents right on your WordPress website. This version of the viewer allows you to store and process documents on your own server.

<h4>Pure HTML5 Document Viewer</h4>

GroupDocs Viewer doesn't rasterize documents but converts them to HTML+CSS+SVG using HTML5 technology. This provides you with the following advantages:

1. <strong>Native text rendering.</strong> Users can select and copy text to the clipboard right from the documents embedded into your website.

2. <strong>High-fidelity display quality.</strong> Thanks to HTML5, documents are scalable and can fit any page or screen size without loss of rendering quality. Fonts always look sharp and the document's layout remains intact.

3. <strong>Cross-platform compatibility.<strong> No need to install Flash, Acrobat Reader or any other plugins client-side. You just embed a document into a web-page and users can view it right away from any browser that supports HTML5.
